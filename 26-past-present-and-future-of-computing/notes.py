Themes of computer science
    * abstraction
        - hiding details
    * universality
        - way to make decisions 'if'
        - way to keep track of variables, data
        - way to keep going using while -> procedures(recursive)
    * recursive definitions
        - Expr -> Expr + Expr
        - Expr -> Number

Opensource
    * Means the source code is openly available and the code can be altered or modified

Quantum Computing
    * bits are just 0s and 1s, interestingly qubits are in a superposition until a measurement is taken
